            <hr/>
            <p>To improve my working conditions (<strong>cough</strong> and get a cleaner battlestation <strong>cough</strong>) I bought a wireless headset from SteeSeries, the Arctis 9.</p>
<p>And you can't have wireless without battery, having to charge the device, etc. Even if this model allows us to use it while charging, it's still unpleasant to have to take it off, wire it, in the middle of a conversation or a meeting. Even more to be locked to your computer when you need to be able to move around.</p>
<p>Natively, we only have 2 ways to get the headset's battery level:</p>
<ul>
<li>A LED, under the ear</li>
</ul>
<p>Put a mirror under your desk or forget about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>An icon in the proprietary app, SteelSeries Engine 3</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where it all started. The manufacturer software show us the headset's battery in a pictogram form, with only 4 levels.</p>
<p><img alt="Picto Arctis 9" src="medias/image-8.png" /></p>
<p>This first problem is obviously the lack of precision, 49% or 26% isn't the same thing, but using this kind of scale make it like it is.</p>
<p>Then come the biggest problem for me, to get this information we need to reach for it. Thought about it, then open the app and check it. I hate that. I don't want to have to open a special app to check the battery level of my stuffs.</p>
<p>One of my android phone's feature I really like is the icon showing the battery level of my bluetooth headset.</p>
<p><img alt="androidscreen" src="medias/androidkit.jpg" /></p>
<p>You can see where it was going, a new obsession was born.</p>
<h2>Headset's Reverse Engineering</h2>
<p>My favorite part ! Let's start with a general environment presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows host</li>
<li>2.4GHZ USB receptor communicating with the headset</li>
<li>VID:PID <code>0x1038</code>: <code>0x12c2</code> &amp; <code>0x12c4</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Informations retournées via USB Tree View" src="medias/image-9.png" /></p>
<p>We are going to focus on <code>0x12c2</code>, the 2nd being, the headset itself, it doesn't interest us, we need the data transiting between it and the dongle.</p>
<p>Why ? Because, by design, it seems logic that it is the dongle receiving this information. If your computer know the model and connecting state of the headset while never being connected to it before, we can deduce this information came from the dongle. </p>
<p>I didn't spend too much time on the proprietary software, after minimal testing on Windows's side (system API &amp; sysinternal) I didn't found anything interesting, so I decided to switch my focus on USB communications.</p>
<p>For this task we call our brother in arms, wireshark. With its plugin, USBPcap, we are able to inspect USB bus packets.</p>
<h3>USB architecture</h3>
<p>Ok, for the next part of the show we need to refresh our memory about the USB architecture. (Thanks to <a href="https://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb6.shtml">BeyondLogic</a>)</p>
<p><img alt="Architecture USB" src="medias/usb-layers.png" /></p>
<p>Host talk with devices via endpoints.</p>
<p>A standard request between host and endpoint look like this:</p>
<p><strong>bmRequestType</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the direction of the request: host to device / device to host</li>
<li>Determine the type of packet being made: standard / class / vendor</li>
<li>Determine the designated recipient: device / interface / endpoint / other</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>bRequest</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the request made</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>wIndex</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Interface number</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>wValue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Additional parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>wLength</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The number of bytes to be transferred is there is a data phase</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Additional data depending on device/software.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that it is clearer (or at least less misty), we can continue !</p>
<h3>Let's have fun</h3>
<p>To be sure to focus on interesting data we start by listening communications without the software closed and headset off. Then we start them up.</p>
<p>Once it's done we get tons of packets to analyze.</p>
<p>In the firsts exchanges the host ask the different devices to return theirs descriptions.(data we have seen earlier in USB Tree View)</p>
<p>By filtering packets on SteelSeries's VID <code>4152</code> (equivalent to <code>0x1038</code>) we retrieve theirs devices addresses.</p>
<p><img alt="Wireshark" src="medias/vid_filter_wireshark.PNG" /></p>
<p>Lucky me, I only own one headset from them, making the cleaning faster. By inspecting the different packets we get this information:</p>
<p><img alt="Found2" src="medias/found2.PNG" /></p>
<p>We can observe, in the returned description returned by the device that our target <code>0x12c2</code> is located in <code>3.15.0</code></p>
<p>We can refine our search and ignore packet not having this device as source nor destination.</p>
<p>Under a lot of noisy packets, one kind seems particularly interesting: <code>SET_REPORT</code></p>
<p>Contrary too other ones, they have a <code>Data</code> field, this one send the <code>0x20</code> value:</p>
<p><img alt="Data" src="medias/image-11.jpg" /></p>
<p>Then we receive a response from <code>3.15.0</code>, which isn't interesting, then another from <code>3.15.1</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="Reponse" src="medias/image-10.jpg" /></p>
<p>This one trigger my spider-sens, the <code>HID DATA</code> field contains weird data from the device. It seems worth to dig on this one.</p>
<h3>Fast forward</h3>
<p>I spare you from the hours spend to analyze the different packets as well as the research of methods to craft HID requests under Windows without getting out of paracetamol.</p>
<p>To note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if I wasn't doubting, my love for development under *nix is confirmed.</li>
<li>Sending packet blindly can be dangerous, during my tests I've KOed and disrupted the headset many times. Good news is, restarting SteelSeries Engine just repushed the settings and reset whatever change I've wrongly made.</li>
<li>For my first POC I've used <a href="https://github.com/libusb/hidapi">hidapi</a> lib which provide a good starting point.</li>
</ul>
<h3>POC</h3>
<p>Thanks to the example files and documentation I was able to have some fun, this is what my POC looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &quot;hidapi.h&quot;

#ifdef _WIN32
    #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#else
    #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#endif

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    (void)argc;
    (void)argv;

    int res;
    unsigned char buf[256];
    #define MAX_STR 255
    wchar_t wstr[MAX_STR];
    hid_device *handle;
    int i;

    struct hid_device_info *devs, *cur_dev;

    printf(&quot;Compiled with hidapi version %s, runtime version %s.\n&quot;, HID_API_VERSION_STR, hid_version_str());
    if (hid_version()-&gt;major == HID_API_VERSION_MAJOR &amp;&amp; hid_version()-&gt;minor == HID_API_VERSION_MINOR &amp;&amp; hid_version()-&gt;patch == HID_API_VERSION_PATCH) {
        printf(&quot;Compile-time version matches runtime version of hidapi.\n\n&quot;);
    }
    else {
        printf(&quot;Compile-time version is different than runtime version of hidapi.\n]n&quot;);
    }

    if (hid_init())
        return -1;

    // Set up the command buffer.
    memset(buf,0x00,sizeof(buf));
    buf[0] = 0x01;
    buf[1] = 0x81;

    // Open the device using the VID, PID
    handle = hid_open(0x1038, 0x12c2, NULL);
    if (!handle) {
        printf(&quot;unable to open device\n&quot;);
        return 1;
    }

    // Read the Product String
    wstr[0] = 0x0000;
    res = hid_get_product_string(handle, wstr, MAX_STR);
    if (res &lt; 0)
        printf(&quot;Unable to read product string\n&quot;);
    printf(&quot;Product found: %ls\n&quot;, wstr);

    // Set the hid_read() function to be non-blocking.
    hid_set_nonblocking(handle, 1);

    buf[0] = 0x0;
    buf[1] = 0x20;
    hid_write(handle, buf, 65);
    if (res &lt; 0)
        printf(&quot;Unable to write() (2)\n&quot;);

    // Read requested state.
    res = 0;
    while (res == 0) {
        res = hid_read(handle, buf, sizeof(buf));
        if (res == 0)
            printf(&quot;waiting...\n&quot;);
        if (res &lt; 0)
            printf(&quot;Unable to read()\n&quot;);
        #ifdef WIN32
        Sleep(500);
        #else
        usleep(500*1000);
        #endif
    }

    printf(&quot;\nData read:\n   &quot;);
    // Print out the returned buffer.
    for (i = 0; i &lt; res; i++)
        printf(&quot;%02hhx &quot;, buf[i]);
    printf(&quot;\n\n&quot;);

    hid_close(handle);
    hid_exit();

#ifdef WIN32
    system(&quot;pause&quot;);
#endif

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>It makes us able to replay the <code>SET_REPORT REQUEST</code> send to <code>3.15.0</code> seen earlier. Then return the response to our terminal. We can now ditch Wireshark and play with the request.</p>
<p><img alt="Output du script" src="medias/image-12.png" /></p>
<h2>Playing with Golang</h2>
<p><img alt="Server Whisperer" src="medias/serverwhisperer.jpg" /></p>
<p>As a SysAdmin/SRE/whateverOPS/Technomancer/Server Whisperer, I wanted to start learning the Go language, nice opportunity we have here !</p>
<h3>HID Library</h3>
<p>After testing a lot of Go project wrapping around HID libraries, I was clueless, every one of them got problems that make me unable to use them. Missing function, Windows compiling not working or not able to work with HID on non *NIX systems...</p>
<p>I finally decided to fork the one I was having the fewer problems on. This was karalabe's one. The only problem I was having was, when calling a function under windows, made the number of bytes written off by 1 by prepending the HID report ID, solved with a 4 lines commits. The fork is available on <a href="https://github.com/qsypoq/hid">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>To recreate the original POC we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the endpoint</li>
<li>Create a buffer containing our request</li>
<li>Write it to the endpoint</li>
<li>Read the response</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;math&quot;

    &quot;github.com/qsypoq/hid&quot;
)

var (
    vid uint = 4152
    pid uint = 4802
)

func open_headset() []byte {
    buf := make([]byte, 9)
    buf[0] = 0x0
    buf[1] = 0x20

    devices := hid.Enumerate(uint16(vid), uint16(pid))
    if len(devices) &gt; 2 {
        headset_info := devices[2]

        headset, err := headset_info.Open()

        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
        }

        defer headset.Close()

        _, err = headset.Write(buf)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Printf(&quot;Write fail: %v&quot;, err)
        }

        _, err = headset.Read(buf)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Printf(&quot;Read fail: %v&quot;, err)
        }
    }

    return buf
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, now that we are able to replay and play with the request, we need to know what the information returned means, how it can be interpreted.</p>
<p>We need to test a certain number of situations, retrieves data, and make correlations out of it.</p>
<p>This is the different situations I tested, with data retrieval for each.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shutdown the headset</li>
<li>Power it on</li>
<li>Let it charge</li>
<li>Let it discharge</li>
</ul>
<h3>Observations &amp; interpretations</h3>
<p>Once all the tests made, we can conclude:</p>
<p>When the headset is on the value of the 2nd byte is <code>1</code></p>
<p><img alt="on" src="medias/on.jpg" /></p>
<p>When the headset is off the value of the 2nd byte is <code>3</code></p>
<p><img alt="off" src="medias/off.jpg" /></p>
<p>When the headset is charging:</p>
<p><img alt="chargingtray" src="medias/charging.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>4th byte value increase with time</li>
<li>5th byte is fixed at <code>1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When the headset isn't charging:</p>
<p><img alt="on" src="medias/on.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>4th byte value decrease with time</li>
<li>5th byte is fixed at <code>0</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So we can now conclude many things here :</p>
<ul>
<li>The 2nd byte is the power state, <code>0</code> when turned off, <code>1</code> when on.</li>
<li>The 4th return the battery level.</li>
<li>The 5th is the charging state, <code>1</code> when charging, else <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, next problem we are facing here: if the 4th byte returned is the battery level, how can we interpret it ?</p>
<p>To understand, and at least try to understand it, I let the headset charge a whole day and night, making sure it was at max charge. Then I opened the SteelEngine app and monitored the returned value from the request matching each battery level logo.</p>
<p>Timing wasn't 100% on point because the software was open on another screen, and I was working on other things at the same time. We can expect a tiny difference between registered values and real values hard-coded in SteelSeries Engine.</p>
<p><img alt="batterylevels" src="medias/image-17.png" /></p>
<p>To note: When charging, the returned battery value is greater than reality, when we take off the charging cable we can see a significant drop of around 21.</p>
<p>Now having some values for major battery steps, we can do some rule of 3 magic, if 25% = 112 &amp; 50% = 125 then 35% should be around 117.</p>
<p>With this method I recreated an approximate scale, by following our statement we can imagine 0% being ~100 in decimal value. This is what it looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="Output du script" src="medias/image-16.png" /></p>
<h2>Tray icon</h2>
<p>OK, now that we are able to get and interprate values returned by our headset the last step is to create a systray app that return us this information visually.</p>
<p>This is the different states we want to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnected</li>
<li>In charge</li>
<li>In use: battery level</li>
</ul>
<h3>Start simple</h3>
<p>So where do we start ? Well, having a basic systray icon working is a good first step. For this I used <a href="https://github.com/getlantern/systray">getlantern's systray library</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind I'm POCing under windows, so the features used will only be the ones compatibles with it.</p>
<p>Basic systray icon:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;io/ioutil&quot;

    &quot;github.com/getlantern/systray&quot;
)

func main() {
    systray.Run(onReady, onExit)
}

func onReady() {
    tooltip := &quot;Headset is Disconnected&quot;
    battery_icon_path := &quot;assets/disconnected.ico&quot;
    systray.SetIcon(getIcon(battery_icon_path))
    systray.SetTooltip(tooltip)
    mQuit := systray.AddMenuItem(&quot;Quit&quot;, &quot;Quit the app&quot;)

    go func() {
        &lt;-mQuit.ClickedCh
        systray.Quit()
    }()
}

func onExit() {}

func getIcon(s string) []byte {
    b, err := ioutil.ReadFile(s)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Print(err)
    }
    return b
}
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<p><img alt="Output du script" src="medias/basic.jpg" /></p>
<p>What are we doing here ?</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getIcon()</code> Read an ICO file and return it</li>
<li><code>SetIcon()</code> set the current icon of our systray</li>
<li><code>SetTooltip()</code> the current tooltip</li>
<li><code>AddMenuItem()</code> add a menu item visible by right-clicking the icon, which we bind to a Quit function, closing the systray. We use a goroutine to listen on it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding some spices</h3>
<p>So, our systray is working now we need to refresh it based on headset's state.
Simply use a goroutine and put the data retrieval and systray update in here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">    go func() {
        for {
            buf := open_headset()

            if buf[1] == 1 {
                returned_battery = float64(buf[3])

                if buf[4] == 1 {
                    battery_icon_path = &quot;assets/charging.ico&quot;
                } else {
                    battery_icon_path = &quot;assets/normal.ico&quot;
                }
            } else {
                battery_icon_path = &quot;assets/disconnected.ico&quot;
            }

            systray.SetIcon(getIcon(battery_icon_path))
            time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
        }
    }()
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is the starting point of our final systray, we call <code>open_headset()</code> which return us the headset datas, then based on them, we update our icon. By appending a sleep at the end of the routine we set the refresh rate at 5 seconds.</p>
<h2>Battery level</h2>
<p>Now the hardest part of the show, let's resume what we have ATM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weird Battery level value returned by the headset</li>
<li>Goroutine refreshing static icon based on headset's information</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of me wanted to go heavily simple and just pre-generate all the icons, like one for every 5% step and just round the returned result to match them. But for reason this doesn't fully satisfy me:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the purpose of all this if in the end I'm still rounding the values ?</li>
<li>Is it a good design to pre-generate on the disk all the icons ? Does it seem like a good idea to package 100 icons ?</li>
</ul>
<p>As all these questions answers are "I don't know, but it's easier". I took it the other way: if it's easier to do then it wouldn't be hard to correct later if I change my mind.</p>
<p>We are here to learn right ?</p>
<p>Next step: translating values into battery percent, and generating icon on the fly.</p>
<h3>From table to formula</h3>
<p>First problem to solve, we have a set of value and corresponding translation. As I don't want to do it in a too noobish form, I wanted to have a formula to use, translating headset's values into battery percent.</p>
<p>Using online reverse formula deduction I ended up with this one:</p>
<p>(-0.005442<em>value²)+(3.196</em>value)-264.9 = Battery percent</p>
<p><img alt="formule" src="medias/formula.jpg" /></p>
<p>Formula's graphic with correlated points from headset's reports:</p>
<p><img alt="formule" src="medias/formula2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Not perfect but still good enough !</p>
<p>Translated to Go, taking account of the charging state variation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func convert_battery(value float64, headset_charging bool) int {
    if headset_charging != false {
        value = value - 21
    }
    return int((-0.005442*(math.Pow(value, float64(2))) + (float64(3.196) * value) - 264.9))
}
</code></pre>
<h2>SysTray Icon generation</h2>
<p>Loading icon from our filesystem is one thing, dynamically generating them is another. Our workflow should look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load a template icon, like a headset with a space in the center which would allow us to write the battery level in it</li>
<li>Retrieve battery's level, convert it to % with <code>convert_battery()</code></li>
<li>Edit the template icon to write battery's level on it</li>
<li>Send the edited icon to <code>SetIcon()</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>What are we missing ?</h3>
<p>The part missing here is the icon edit one. Using <a href="github.com/fogleman/gg">fogleman's gg library</a> we can create a simple function applying text over an image:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type edit_req struct {
    BgImgPath string
    FontPath  string
    FontSize  float64
    Text      string
}

func txt_on_img(request edit_req) (image.Image, error) {
    bgImage, err := gg.LoadImage(request.BgImgPath)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    imgWidth := bgImage.Bounds().Dx()
    imgHeight := bgImage.Bounds().Dy()

    dc := gg.NewContext(imgWidth, imgHeight)
    dc.DrawImage(bgImage, 0, 0)

    if err := dc.LoadFontFace(request.FontPath, request.FontSize); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    x := float64(imgWidth / 2)
    y := float64((imgHeight / 2))
    maxWidth := float64(imgWidth)
    dc.SetColor(color.White)
    dc.DrawStringWrapped(request.Text, x, y, 0.5, 0.5, maxWidth, 1.5, gg.AlignCenter)

    return dc.Image(), nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>We create a struct embedding the required information about our edit:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>BgImgPath</code>: Path to the template icon</li>
<li><code>FontPath</code>:  Path to font to use</li>
<li><code>FontSize</code>:  Desired font size</li>
<li><code>Text</code>:      Desired text</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we send it to our <code>txt_on_img()</code> function, summary of what we are doing from here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load the image</li>
<li>Create a new blank image with original one's bounds using <code>NewContext()</code></li>
<li>Draw the original image in it using <code>DrawImage()</code></li>
<li>Then draw over the text in its center using <code>DrawStringWrapped()</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>BackLuck Adam aka wtf is kern ?</h3>
<p>On my way down to this I encountered a weird issue, which I didn't know about and made me though my code was wrong. Do you even font bro ? I present you a <a href="https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/1162">kern issue</a>.</p>
<p>TLDR: In the Truetype standard, the kern table contains the values that adjust the intercharacter spacing for glyphs in a font. It can have multiple subtables that can contain information for vertical or horizontal text.</p>
<p>So basically, the font I was using got its kern table malformed, resulting in an error while get used by <code>DrawStringWrapped()</code>. Changed it with a correct one and voilà, it works !</p>
<h3>Convert to ICO</h3>
<p>As you can see the library need an <code>image.Image</code> input which is not what the systray expect as valid icon. What does it expect then ? A byte array of a decoded ICO file.</p>
<p>To make this easier we will do it like this:
- Instead of loading an ICO file, we will load a PNG one, which will made the road from FS to edited image flawless.
- Then we will convert it to ICO before feeding it to <code>SetIcon()</code>.</p>
<p>To appreciate more this step it's recommended to know stuffs about <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20101018-00/?p=12513">how ICO files struct looks like</a>.</p>
<p>Following this explanation we should create icondir and icondirentry structs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type icondir struct {
    reserved  uint16
    imageType uint16
    numImages uint16
}

type icondirentry struct {
    imageWidth   uint8
    imageHeight  uint8
    numColors    uint8
    reserved     uint8
    colorPlanes  uint16
    bitsPerPixel uint16
    sizeInBytes  uint32
    offset       uint32
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then we create functions which generate them and use them to convert our newly generated image to ICO, storing it in a byte array, just waiting to be send to our systray !</p>
<p>Which look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func newIcondir() icondir {
    var id icondir
    id.imageType = 1
    id.numImages = 1
    return id
}

func newIcondirentry() icondirentry {
    var ide icondirentry
    ide.colorPlanes = 1
    ide.bitsPerPixel = 32
    ide.offset = 22
    return ide
}

func convert_to_ico(w io.Writer, im image.Image) error {
    b := im.Bounds()
    m := image.NewRGBA(b)
    draw.Draw(m, b, im, b.Min, draw.Src)

    id := newIcondir()
    ide := newIcondirentry()

    pngbb := new(bytes.Buffer)
    pngwriter := bufio.NewWriter(pngbb)
    png.Encode(pngwriter, m)
    pngwriter.Flush()
    ide.sizeInBytes = uint32(len(pngbb.Bytes()))

    bounds := m.Bounds()
    ide.imageWidth = uint8(bounds.Dx())
    ide.imageHeight = uint8(bounds.Dy())
    bb := new(bytes.Buffer)

    var e error
    binary.Write(bb, binary.LittleEndian, id)
    binary.Write(bb, binary.LittleEndian, ide)

    w.Write(bb.Bytes())
    w.Write(pngbb.Bytes())

    return e
}
</code></pre>
<p>Mix things together:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func generate_tray_level(level int) []byte {
    txtimg, _ := txt_on_img(
        edit_req{
            BgImgPath: &quot;assets/normal.png&quot;,
            FontPath:  &quot;assets/FiraSans-SemiBold.ttf&quot;,
            FontSize:  256,
            Text:      fmt.Sprint(level),
        },
    )

    bufff := new(bytes.Buffer)
    err := convert_to_ico(bufff, txtimg)

    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(&quot;failed to create buffer&quot;, err)
    }

    return bufff.Bytes()
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now to retrieves battery level, generate an icon and put it in the systray all we need to do is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">headset_battery = convert_battery(returned_battery, headset_charging)
systray.SetIcon(generate_tray_level(headset_battery))
</code></pre>
<h3>Final result</h3>
<p>Mix things together with algorithms and our app is finally ready !</p>
<p>Last but not least, the video demo.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>As I may switch to another OS sooner or later, I should make sure the app is compatible with macOS &amp; Linux.</p>
<p>As I may switch to another headset too, I should make the app use an external configuration file to make it compatible with alternatives.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm happy with my results, I now have a working app feeling my needs, and I learned some Go. One step further toward Terraform plugins !</p>
